# Memory Game

This project was built with React as training project.

## Installation

### `git clone https://github.com/categrame/memory.git`
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

And that's it :)

You can also connect a firebase database to register the scores.

Just add a .env file at the root of your project, and then add the environnement variable REACT_APP_FIREBASE_LINK = {your firebase json link} inside.

HAVE FUN :D
